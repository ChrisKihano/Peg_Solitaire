Description: Solver for peg solitaire game in a triangle format. Can create triangle boards that are triangle with
             length n and any initial board configuration. This solution uses a tree structure to split possible next
             actions and allows for backtracking if a non-solution path has been taken. Inspired by the peg solitaire
             game at Cracker Barrel.
Further Improvements: Optimizations may include detection for symmetry to reduce computation. For example, in the
                      default setup, there are two possible initial moves, but they're symmetrical of each other. Any
                      solution of one would be a mirror copy of the other reducing the number of iterations by half.

                      Allowing for additional layouts of boards including a cross, triangle without tips, stars. These
                      would require either additional equations to find valid moves or hardcoded boards.
